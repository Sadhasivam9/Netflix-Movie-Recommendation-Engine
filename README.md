# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-Engine 
In this Project we will be creating one such Recommendation Engine from the ground up, where every single user, based on there area of interest and ratings, would be recommended a list of movies that are best suited for them.
# Dataset Used
Two datasets are used in this project 
1) Netflix prize dataset - combined_data_1.txt
contains the customer ID, Movie ID and Ratings
3) Movie titles.
Contains details of movies including Movie_Id, Movie_Name, and Year.
# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust Netflix movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system aims to:
1) Identify the Most Popular and Liked Movies:
Determine the movies with the highest number of ratings.
Identify movies with the highest average ratings.
2) Develop a Recommendation Model:
Implement collaborative filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.
3) Identify the Best and Worst-Rated Movies:
Calculate and display the highest and lowest-rated movies based on user ratings.
# Model Building:
Used matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to build the recommendation model.
Recommendation Generation:
Generated top N movie recommendations for specific users.
